Recently I've been making an effort to eat interesting cheeses. Lots of people
like cheese and it's [fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3KBuQHHKx0) to try
new things. Here are some of my favorites:

<br />


### Limberger

This was a soft cheese. Not as soft as a brie, but soft nontheless. It also had
a pleasant bacteria rind which is something I always like. It has a nice
strong odor to it too. **10/10**.

<br />


### White Stilton with Cranberries

Texture was pleasantly both crumbly and creamy. Not runny at all.  Flavor was
off the charts --- just the right combination of sweet and savory. **10/10**.

Do you know of any other cheeses I should add to the list?  If so, do not hesistate to let me know!
