Datadog \\
Senior Engineering Manager \\
2023 - 2025 
& At Datadog, I was a founding engineer of the Network Monitoring product suite. Network Monitoring allows network operators and SREs to understand how traffic flows across their network as well as the health of individual network components. After working as an IC on the team for a year, I stepped into a management role, and continue to lead the engineering team today.
I managed a group of 20+ engineers working across web frontends, streaming pipelines, and kernel level programming.  I handled hiring, people management, technical architecture, and roadmapping while continuing to review and author code.
I was the owner of Cloud Network Monitoring during a period of growth, where I helped scale from zero to hundreds of thousands of installed hosts and thousands of paying customers. In doing so, I solved numerous performance and distributed systems problems.
I worked closely with customers, product management, and engineers to define requirements and early architecture of an SNMP profile editor, and highly available SNMP collector, both of which were hard requirements to close several six figure deals.
I was part of a company wide on-call rotation that managed complex, multi-team outages.
