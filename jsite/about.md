Hi, my name is Lee Avital and I’m a fourth year computer science student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I’m an engineer intern at Twitter.

I’ve done a lot of work in web development — writing large javascript applications with backends in Scala, PHP, and ASP Classic.

Some of my experience:
 
 - I’ve worked as an engineer at Twitter.
 - I’ve worked at Drawbridge as a platform engineer. Drawbridge is a demand side platform for real-time ad-bidding.
 - I’ve worked at Massdrop as an engineer. Massdrop is a platform that allows buyers to leverage their numbers and get better prices on the products they want.

I’ve worked as a web developer at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf working on web-based tools to enhance the classroom experience for both hearing and non-hearing students.

I’m very interested in programming languages. Right now, my language of choice is Scala, a strongly typed, functional programming language that runs on the JVM.

You can read all about that on my blog.
