<h1>About Me</h1>
            
<p>Hi, my name is <b>Lee Avital</b> and I&#8217;m a second year computer science student at the <a href='http://rit.edu'> Rochester Institute of Technology</a>.</p>

<p>I recently finished an internship at <a href='http://massdrop.com'>massdrop.com</a> as a full stack engineer intern.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve done a lot of work in <b>web development</b> &#8212; writing large javascript applications with backends in everything from django on a linux box to ASP Classic on a windows server.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve worked as a web developer at the <a href='http://ntid.rit.edu'> National Technical Institute for the Deaf</a> working on web-based tools to enhance the classroom experience for both hearing and non-hearing students.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve also done independent work starting with <a href='Ethereal-Commerce'>Ethereal Commerce</a> and more recently with <a href='SNAP/index.html'>SNAP</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;m also very interested in programming languages &#8212; their designs, their implementations and their applications. Right now, I&#8217;m learning <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_%28programming_language%29'> Erlang</a>, a neat conncurency based programming language.</p>
