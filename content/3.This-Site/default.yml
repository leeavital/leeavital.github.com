   This site was written using the delightful 
   <a href="http://tinytree.info">bonsai static site generator</a>
   by <a href="http://twitter.com/benschwarz">Ben Shwarz</a>. A great
   tool build in ruby that lets me write my content in YAML files
   and my templates in liquid.

   It also features a bit of javascript based responsive design, so go ahead and resize
   that screen! (if you're feeling curious, check out the page source)
