Hi, my name is  **Lee Avital**.  Right now I'm an engineer manager at 
[DataDog](https://datadoghq.com) where I build stuff for Network Engineers and SREs.

Some of my experience:

- I was a software engineer at [Palantir](https://palantir.com).
- I was an engineer intern at [Twitter](http://twitter.com).
- I was a platform engineer intern at [Drawbridge](http://drawbrid.ge), a demand side platform for real-time ad-bidding.
- I was a engineer intern at [Massdrop](http://massdrop.com) as an engineer.
  Massdrop is a platform that allows buyers to leverage their numbers and get
  better prices on the products they want.
- I've worked as a web developer at the [National Technical Institute for the Deaf](http://ntid.rit.edu "NTID")
working on web-based  tools to enhance the classroom experience for both hearing and
non-hearing students.

I'm interested in programming languages, performance, and developer tools.

You can read all about that on [my blog.](/blog)
