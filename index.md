Hi, my name is  **Lee Avital**.
I'm a software engineer at [Palantir.](https://www.palantir.com/)


I've done a lot of work in **web development** &mdash; writing
large javascript applications with backends in Scala, PHP, and
ASP Classic.

Some of my experience:

- I've worked as an engineer at [Twitter.](http://twitter.com)
- I've worked at [Drawbridge](http://drawbrid.ge) as a platform engineer. Drawbridge
is a demand side platform for real-time ad-bidding.
- I've worked at [Massdrop](http://massdrop.com "Massdrop") as an engineer. Massdrop is
 a platform that allows buyers to leverage their numbers and get better
 prices on the products they want.
- I've worked as a web developer at the [National Technical Institute for the Deaf](http://ntid.rit.edu "NTID")
working on web-based  tools to enhance the classroom experience for both hearing and
non-hearing students.



I'm very interested in programming languages. Right now, my language of choice
is [Scala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language "Scala"), a
strongly typed, functional programming language that runs on the JVM.

You can read all about that on [my blog.](/blog)
